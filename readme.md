# Imaginarium Syntax Highlighting

This is a custom syntax highlighting package for use alongside [Ian
Horswill's Imaginarium](https://github.com/ianhorswill/Imaginarium), a
tool for casual constraint-based procedural content generation.

You can install this package manually by cloning and moving its contents
to your sublime text packages folder.
